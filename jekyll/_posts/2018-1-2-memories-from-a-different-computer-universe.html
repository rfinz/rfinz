<p>
Since the 1970s, Ted Nelson's software teams have probably spent
most of their time contemplating memory. By his own account, a team
"bogged down over a four-year period as the group attempted to
optimize the [ent] structure", which was used in one of Ted's
hypertext systems.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can tell, however, the zzstructured universe remains
free of any memory mandate. Computers are fast now that it's 2017 (2018),
and at least initially (and probably in perpetuity) this is a
personal project, so I don't have to worry too much about
performance.
</p>

<p>
That said, I want a reliable and at least workably efficient way to
serialize my topologies to disk and load them back up again. XML
seems inefficient, though there was at least one mid-2000s attempt
at software similar to this that could <i>load</i> XML(thornyscript?)
into legitimate zzstructure (not that <i>my</i> different computer
universe is identical to Ted's, but he's a big inspiration for the
project, so, shoutout to Ted).
</p>

<p>
I could rely on sqlite or mongo or some other database software to
keep track of stuff when I'm not looking. Honestly, sqlite, despite
then imposing structure on what is supposed to be mostly fluid,
seems like a good option.
</p>

<p>
I would need a way to create UUIDs for Cells, Dimensions, and
Topologies, which, not coincidentally, would be our tables. Links
(unlike in most of the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/memex/ACM_HypertextTestbed/papers/60.html">Xanalogical</a> structures), are not first
class, and so must be represented in a translation table that can
bind two cells together over a link.
</p>

<p>
Maybe that's not actually the best course of action, and the same can
be achieved via the filesystem. Simple filenames for each cell, and
predictable file contents that capture content and dimensional links
would work just fine.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty certain that I don't need to worry too much about
ents, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfilade_(Xanadu)">enfilades</a>, and such &#x2013; at least not initially. When the unit
of editing I'm worried about is the <code>Cell</code>, I don't need to keep
explicit track of individual bytes. I have some ideas for bytes,
but that can wait.

<h3 id="org0b3d496">Part 2 - Quick Implementation (Write)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0b3d496">
<p>
In order to get this project off the ground I'm going to go with the
fastest (to implement) solution I can think of. I'm just going to
write a single function to write files for each of the cells in the
single dimension. Ultimately I'll keep track of all new and changed
cells in a dedicated dimension called something like <code>d.dirty</code> so that
I make sure I don't miss anything.
</p>

<p>
I can implement something more complicated later. This is elegant, at
least, and I won't waste too much time worrying about the nits and
grits of it.
</p>

<p>
Classic UUIDs still make decent filenames, and it gives me a way to
easily disambiguate cells and reference them outside of my little
zzstructured universe as well. I'd like to use domain based UUIDs
eventually, but random works just fine for now. There's a Rust crate
for the Uuids, and version 4 is random bits.
</p>

<p>
Here's the file format I'd like to use:
</p>

<pre class="example">
ContentType
Content
negward-&gt;Dimension1-&gt;posward
negward-&gt;Dimension2-&gt;posward
negward-&gt;Dimension3-&gt;posward
...
</pre>

<p>
Human readable, relatively semantic, no frills. Not bad. Not good
either, but, meh. I would love to implement something more performant
in the future. We'll see.
</p>

<p>
Getting this done isn't so bad. Writing out can be gradual, and there
aren't many contingencies to plan for at this stage.
</p>

<p>
Reading, however&#x2026;
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org79c58d6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org79c58d6">Part 3 - See, the thing is</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79c58d6">
<p>
Okay, so writing can be gradual, but reading has to create valid
links&#x2013; which means that I either have to fully load the <code>Cell</code> on the
<i>other side</i> of that link, or I have to build the infrastructure for
some sort of "preloaded" state. Let me know if there are more options
that I haven't thought of.
</p>

<p>
I think to "preload", I can create a new member of the <code>enum CellType</code>
that encapsulates that idea. I can then create new <code>Cells</code> with the
Uuids that I loaded from the file format I specified above, and
whenever the final programs hit a <code>Cell</code> with <code>CellType</code> "preloaded",
it can be smart enough to request the rest of that <code>Cell</code> and update
the <code>CellType</code> to whatever the file specifies. Again, this isn't
rocket science.
</p>

<p>
This solution works. It's a very general solution, and should
minimally meet the needs of any front end that my stupid dumb hands
can write. Next time I'll work on some sort of socket server for this
thing, and implement the logic to actually run something zzstructured
(and xanalogical?).
</p>

<p>
For now, all of these memories exist in their own <a href="https://github.com/rfinz/slumberland/blob/master/memories/src/lib.rs">module.</a>
