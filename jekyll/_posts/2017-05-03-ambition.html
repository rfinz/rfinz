Ambition is a sticky subject. I think I used to have it. Now I'm not
sure I do. I don't know if I have the stomach for ambition. I'd rather
keep working in records, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Ambition is a will to succeed? An "an ardent desire for rank, fame, or
power" (from <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambition">Merriam Webster</a>). <i>Ambitious</i> is how we describe politicians, actors,
and CEOs. Ambition is desirable in a partner. Ambition garners status
and praise. Ambition often disappoints.
</p>

<p>
"Rank, fame, or power." The traditional signifiers of success. The
tricks we played on men to encourage them to take great risks and
incur great rewards, with the great<i>er</i> good in mind.

<h3 id="orgae0257e">Success</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgae0257e">
<p>
Success is incumbent upon either extreme singlemindedness and luck, or
extreme luck and singlemindedness. In the modern world you must
specialize to break out. The generalist is useful, but
unrecognizable. You don't find internet fame writing a blog post twice
a year and occasionally re-plumbing your home. You aren't recorded in
the annals of history for your mediocre punditry and passable game of
golf. You can't make buckets of money working part-time on your
dream. Unless they have the great luck to be born into it, wealth and
fame will not find the scattered and undisciplined.
</p>

<p>
Ambition is fuel for singlemindedness. It overrides the desire for a
temperate life and forces the mind into the narrow channels that lead
towards success. It coerces thought, justifies action, and encourages
us to 'other' those that aren't on the same path. What do people have,
if not things to contribute? Get on the train or get out of the way.
</p>

<p>
Ambition&#x2013;success&#x2013;needs you to <i>know</i> that you're on the right path,
that whatever it that you are doing is what you are <i>meant</i> to do, as
if given instructions from above. It requires a certain arrogance to
believe.

<h3 id="orgf8f110f">Pro-social(?) amathia</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf8f110f">
<p>
Ambition seems to require a conceited ignorance of the plurality of
choices spread out before you. Your choice of occupation, of endeavor,
of way of life&#x2013; this is the one. If you haven't made a choice, then
perhaps the endeavor is to find a perfect way of life, politic, or
occupation, and you're dead certain that you can find it.
</p>

<p>
Amathia, designer of those lives too arrogant for reflection,
<a href="https://woodybelangia.com/2014/09/08/ignorance-vs-stupidity/">a-mathia</a>: “not-learning”, a stupidity uncured by education. Unwise,
un-correctable, single-minded. Ambition sounds like amathia, applied.
</p>

<p>
The results of this amathic ambition can be tragic. Ambition
kills. Every great leader, and especially every great murderer, had
ambition. Amathia is what powers fascism; ambition a familiar, human
application of pure fervor.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the results can also be incredible. Ambition may be the
most beneficial application of ignorance that has ever
existed. Without ambition we would have none of the great works of
humanity. The ambitions to eradicate disease or contribute to human
knowledge are worthy ones, and ultimately human progress is worth the
chance of disastrous human stupidity.
</p>

<p>
Ambition, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrvkxFIlb4">tantric buddhism</a>, is the short path by which success is
attainable in a human lifetime. Shortcuts are dangerous, though, and
amathia is the rut that carries the wheel off the hub. As such, tantra
and ambition are not for the faint of heart.
</p>

<p>
What are we to do for those whose ambition carries them to the top? Is
the premium on ambition too high? Are the great numbers of the
ambitious diminishing returns?

<h3 id="org5a96f5d">Melancholy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5a96f5d">
<p>
Melancholy is the natural enemy of ambition. Sadness may <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholia#Art_movement">occasionally</a>
inspire great art (or at least sadness may be a fashionable emotion to
display in art), but sadness without ambition cannot compete in a
world filled with discontent and drive. Sadness is the end of a
struggle, the battle lost, the talent forgotten, the friendship
over. To exist in total sadness is to exist without goals. Complete
anhedonia is to exist without motivation.
</p>

<p>
Part of the draw of a city like New York or LA is that everyone is out
there striving for something. People go there to prove something, to
"make something of themselves," and find fame and fortune. This is all
well and good, but for reference, actors make up .02% of the
population and CEOs of publicly traded companies just .0006%. Still,
if you don't think about it too much it's easier to ride the wave and
strive for something of your own when there's actually a wave to ride.
</p>

<p>
Seemingly opposed are communities that excel at providing
contentment. These places have strong communities, relaxed identity,
good social services, and plenty of public hedonism.
</p>

<p>
These cities, like Minneapolis, Portland, or Boulder, offer something
to the melancholic that the big cities can't: the consideration that
just getting along and finding happiness is enough. Owning a small
business, contributing something to a local festival, hell&#x2013;even
inviting some friends out to that local festival and enjoying the
day&#x2013;this is enough.

<h3 id="orgf894742">Eudaimonia</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf894742">
<p>
Bliss is on the other side of melancholy, and quiet goallessness the
sensation of <a href="{% post_url 2017-03-01-travel-blog %}">salience</a>. Things as they are, the meanings laid
bare. Comfort in uncertainty, for certainty is surely(?) the sign of
amathic cataclysm, inchoate.
</p>

<p>
Eudaimonia, the good life, self-actualization, does this require
ambition? Ambition, just as it is?
</p>

<p>
Temperate ambition, ignorance, un-wisdom, un-learning, paradoxically
now a requirement for its own undoing.
</p>

<p>
How do we strive without ambition? How do we find meaning in sadness?
What is achievement without rank, fame, or power? Is contentment
enough?
