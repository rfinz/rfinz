No, not the vomit kind. Okay maybe.
</p>

<p>
As I've prattled on about before, human beings spend a lot of time
either <i>a)</i> subconsciously sorting things into categories (right,
wrong, dark, light, progress, regress, etc) or <i>b)</i> consciously
deciding what categories things go in, with an awareness that the
categories are fuzzy and the points don't matter and live from new
york it's saturday night. You can try, but you can't escape it, and
in this weird wide world containing the internet, where we can be
exposed to any ideas that we choose, and in the privacy of our own
homes make decisions about how we are going to engage with those
ideas, we need to hone our metacognitive
skills. Meta-metacognitive? Idk. You get the
concept. Concept. Concept. Say it three times and turn in a
circle. Concepts are&#x2026; what? Ideas? Beliefs? Grouping of those
things?
</p>

<p>
Categories are tangent to what I want to talk about, concepts are
adjacent to it: the bit I need is the psychological concept of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunk</a>. Chunking, and the paper that first synthesized the concept,
"<i>The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our
Capacity for Processing Information</i>," are such cultural staples
that any writing on the topic is bound to seem trite, but here we
go. The important bit is this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A chunk is defined as a familiar collection of more elementary units
that have been inter-associated and stored in memory repeatedly and
act as a coherent, integrated group when retrieved. &#x2013; Wikipedia
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Tulving, E., &amp; Craik, F
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Chunks are psychic objects, the basic building blocks with which we
assemble our working memory, and thereby our thought. It doesn't
matter if a chunk is a single binary digit, or a re-coding into
higher space therefrom, or the entire idea of "whale", or "pizza",
or "nazism", or "blog." Our largest chunks confine our largest
thoughts. Chunks are how we contemplate the world. Refinement of
our chunks is refinement of our consciousness. This is how
"chunking" can be tidily inverted, now a big glass bowl
encompassing some of the more political and philosophical things
that we can discuss.
</p>

<p>
Chunking is sublimely underrated as a tool for more effective
understandings of consciousness and the workings therein.
</p>

<p>
I'm aware of one other work on this topic, and a neat, Maria Popova
summary is available <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/04/the-ravenous-brain-daniel-bor/">here</a>. I haven't read the book, but it
certainly seems interesting, and a definitively more scientific
description than the allusions, metaphors, and inanity offered
herein.
</p>

<p>
To be aware that chunking is necessary, chunking is largely
unconscious, chunking is how we are socialized, and chunking is the
product of our own personal investigation, is to be aware of the
forces that divide, and the forces that unite us in
humanity. Education can become "tools to encourage re-chunking."
Drugs "encourage the rapid disintegration of chunks." Inspiration
contains the "rapid expansion of a chunk to contain new contexts."
</p>

<p>
It's criminally easy to abuse the metaphor (chunk) of chunks, and
it sounds insane, which is why I've tried to explain these things
to exactly zero people.

<h3 id="orga5ea449">Ontology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga5ea449">
<p>
Ontology is concerned with reality and its categories. It's one
big arm of metaphysics (that statement itself being an ontological
assessment), and it's everywhere. You just have to know where to
look.
</p>

<p>
Reasoning about the nature of reality, about the fundamental
properties of a thing, about what markers are needed to fill the
requirements of an <i>identity</i>, questions of <i>self</i> versus <i>other</i>
and <i>in-group</i> versus <i>out-group</i>, these are actually (and often
unconsciously) works of ontology.
</p>

<p>
What the nonsensical introduction was getting at, then, is that,
like it or not, we spend an inordinate amount of time doing
(committing?) <i>ontology</i>.
</p>

<p>
Ontology, neurologically speaking, could just be the study of
chunks. I'm willing to bet enough on this to type words into a
computer, so I'd say I'm pretty sure. Since ontology is focused on
the boundaries of things, and chunks are the psychic set of
boundaries between concepts, objects, and more, chunks are a
superset of ontology.
</p>

<p>
Ontology is also in charge of the categories themselves. You
cannot determine what category an item belongs to without first
having a list of categories. Categories are established through
the process of comparison that identifies "like" things.
</p>

<p>
When we say that one thing is like another thing, we've made a
metaphor, and we're thinking analogically. Categorization <i>is</i>
metaphorization.

<h3 id="org7db73b9">Semantics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7db73b9">
<p>
I made a groaner the other night, realizing that semantics is
metaphor without hyperbole &#x2013; the unit metaphor is straightforward
and useful. Of course, if there are unit metaphors, then maybe
there are scalar metaphors, or metaphor transforms. Who knows?
</p>

A chair is a construction of wood, cushion, or otherwise, that
facilitates sitting. A stool is like a chair, but dumber. You
prefer stools? Psychopath.

Her eyes were cerulean kiddie pools. Her eyes were bubbles of
fluid for focusing light on a sensor. It's not pretty, but it gets
the job done.
</p>

<p>
The very descriptive act is one of comparison, the decision that
things are like other things.

<p>
Funny joke! Creative, collective definition is all of our
jobs&#x2026; some people are just more aware of it than others.
</p>

<p>
Semantics is fundamentally description, description is
fundamentally metaphor, and metaphor fundamentally chunking. We're
captive on a carousel of time. Every time I say fundamentally I
draw a big red circle around my categorization impulse and further
entrench this stupid chunking idea.
</p>

<p>
As we unroll semantics and look more deeply at what words and
definitions <i>are</i>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/16/5/852.html">semantic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation">satiation</a> seems to wink wink nudge
nudge at deep neurological implications. When we use a word into
total exhaustion we temporarily rob our mind of the word's
usefulness. We lose its <i>meaning</i>, its <i>chunk</i>, its metaphorical,
ontological <i>way of being</i>. The hole it leaves is terrifying. How
did you spend so long with the sense of this thing, only to lose
it into the ether? Even more terrifyingly, related concepts are
<i>also</i> weakened. If we lose our "table" chunk, we weaken our
"desk" chunk. The miasma of an idea, the metaphorical and physical
relatedness of the building blocks of our consciousness, can be
partially dissolved by the words we choose to assign them.
</p>

<p>
Is this why repeated chants channel such great power? Is it that
filling the mind with (what are now) nonsense syllables clears
your pool of conscious thought and makes space for something less
verbal? Something closer to god?
</p>

<p>
Is the inverse phenomena of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossolalia">glossolalia</a> just that? Nonsense
syllables of a cleared mind? Is glossolalic interpretation hearing
nonsense and understanding, while semantic satiation is hearing
real words and failing?

<h3 id="org683da68">Jargon</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org683da68">
<p>
Jargon seems like an arbitrary barrier to entry for any given
academic field. It's arcane, it's needlessly complicated, it's
elitist, and it seems, from an outsider's perspective, that
regular ol' words will do just fine, thank you.
</p>

<p>
People "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_engineering">in the know</a>" already know that the entirety of a field's
jargon is its "ontology." When there was a push for the "Semantic
Web," ontology was also the chunk they used to represent domain
knowledge, saying, in one common example, that a book site would
use "author" where a more general site might use "creator." Author
is more descriptive than creator. It captures more information
&#x2013;more context&#x2013; than creator, and represents a larger chunk.
</p>

<p>
Jargon, domain knowledge, ontology, chunks&#x2013; these things capture
information much more complex than simple words, their phonemes,
or even their definitions. When you enter a specialized field
these chunks contain increasingly large amounts of
information. Eventually some information is added that causes one
chunk to diverge from a previous version. To distinguish new
chunks from older chunks, new vocabulary is invented.
</p>

<p>
It is when working with these complex ideas that jargon becomes
desirable, since specialized vocabulary is imbued with the
potentiality of triggering chunk loads, allowing the reader or
thinker to access larger and larger pieces of information
simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
The cargo-cultist possesses the half of a chunk that is
superficially available, without bothering to (or knowing enough
to) ferret out more deep and nuanced meaning. It is always the job
of philosophers (and <i>Doctors of Philosophy in <span class="underline"><span class="underline">__</span></span></i>) to
spend enough time with the meanings of things that the whole
chunks are uncovered and the full context made apparent once
again.
</p>

<h3 id="orgd0e2f64">Vocabulary Words / Foreign Words</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd0e2f64">
<p>
Sometimes true meanings are obliterated by our proximity to
them.
</p>

<p>
Boredom is a powerful chunk containing dissatisfaction with the
state of reality and the urge to escape it. It is listlessness and
aimlessness and existential anxiety. How often do we unpack
boredom? When we speak "boredom" do we expect our listeners to
unpack the chunk and actually feel something? Maybe it's easier to
use a word that makes us work a little harder, allowing us to
become aware of its subtlety as we think. How about <i>ennui</i>?
<i>Ennui</i> is beautiful, and for me has always captured the more
"real" bits of boredom. I'm not bored of an activity. Activities
are easy to find. Maybe I'm bored of <i>all</i> of this.
</p>

<p>
Maybe <i>ennui</i> is already too loaded, "loading" in this context is
a flattening of our chunks so that they look, from the outside,
like things much less complex than they are, removing the
intensity of meaning in a hedonic treadmill. Thoughts can only
move us for so long. Cargo cults are shallow, like the
understanding gleaned from <a href="{% post_url 2017-03-01-travel-blog %}">visiting</a> a place, but never living
there.
</p>

<p>
Other times, however, a language is entirely missing a word to
capture a particular chunk. It somewhat bothers me when I see
"untranslatable words" or things of that ilk, because of course
english is infinitely expressive, and what they mean is that there
is no single word translation. But, when brevity is desired or you
would like to instantly trigger the loading of a particular,
<i>huge</i> chunk, using a foreign word is infinitely more
efficient. At this point foreign words become jargon for our
everyday experience.  <i>Fremdschämen</i> from German, <i>Saudade</i> from
Portuguese, the <i>Vus</i> from French. These words have no "simple"
translation, but immediately and thoroughly capture potent
chunkcepts. I've wept over beautiful words. This is okay. I'm
fine.

<h3 id="org3c0aaab">Genius and a few good chunks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3c0aaab">
<p>
I read somewhere [citation needed(probably from inside the
rationality-web)] that even the most genius people have only a few
good tricks: a set of mental tools by which they approach every
problem. If their tricks don't work, maybe file the problem away
for a while until new tricks can be learned or new information can
be gleaned about the problem itself. Being productive dictates
shelving unpleasant problems from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the tricks are reductions, incarnations of the analogical thinking
that ontology empowers. The question is always 'is this problem
"like" another problem?' Is there an approach I know that works
here, too? Are the logical threads the same?  Are the crossings of
rope unique to this problem not so unique after all?  Is it the
same knot in a different context? I've wept over the same knots in
different contexts. This is okay. I'm fine.
</p>

<p>
Computicians[sic] are already directly aware of these workings:
progress in this field almost always occurs via the reduction of
one problem to another &#x2013; what once seemed intractable now
accessible through the arcane machinations and mathematics of
yore. If one problem is reducible to another, it is already
solved.
</p>

<p>
As we've seen, most work is just figuring out what things are like
other things anyway. Poetry. <i>Poiesis</i>. Creation.

<p>
That's the sound of a new metaphor falling into place, your new
analogy another brick in the wall of Knowledge. You've compared
two things, and now you understand. This is the nature of
knowledge, that text is nothing without context.
</p>

<p>
By comparing two things, you've encouraged their chunks to merge,
you're blurring the boundary between one thing and another. We can
say, when speaking analogically, "of course I don't <i>literally</i>
mean that one thing is like another, but of course it is. It is if
our unit metaphors are tight enough.
</p>

<p>
The moment of epiphany is a spectacular subduction of one chunk by
another, the sublime rumblings of expanding definitions and better
comparisons, stories to tell yourself that feel more whole, and a
better angle on the facts.
</p>

<p>
Epiphany feels so good because your brain finally knows where to
put things. What a relief.

<h3 id="org0c16f3a">Explainers, and encouraging others to "Get It"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0c16f3a">
<p>
If this blog has a purpose, it is to realign your perception of
the world to be just a little bit more similar to my own. This is
often the goal of "explainers," articles, videos, books, that are
an attempt by one human to explain something to another. Sometimes
this works well, and is necessary, like apprenticeships in trades
and membership in dojos for the physical arts. Sometimes it seems
to fall flat, like in the case of personal advice columns and
self-help books.
</p>

<p>
When we explain, if we feel frustration at someone else not
"getting it" they either haven't heard us correctly, or their
information is chunked such that whatever new info you've provided
is being sorted into a pile that might not even exist in your
brain.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these piles can be the source of our greatest
naïvetés. Progress &#x2013; new, better perspectives, are available to
those who are just now in the process of building up their chunks,
and much can be gained by questioning the validity of some of our
more "fundamental" chunks. Gender is a good chunk to break
apart. Gender contains a lot of information, and has historically
been very useful. But gender chunks contain humans, and humans are
tricky.
</p>

<p>
In this case we may do well to chunk less information in gender,
and work more slowly out from there.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe we would do better to chunk <i>more</i> information with
gender, including more information about ambiguity, spectrum, and
complexity. In this case we must still make sure we don't become
desensitized to meaning&#x2013; we must unpack gender every time we
speak of it.
</p>

<p>
Maybe the real trick is only to use foreign words for gender.
</p>

<p>
I've gotten derailed. I hope when you pick up your chunks you find
them healthy and whole.
