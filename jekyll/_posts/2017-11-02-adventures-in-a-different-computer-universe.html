<h3 id="org31d5a62">Part 1 - What's the idea here?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org31d5a62">
<p>
The great <a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>, now a ripe 80 years old, has spent the better
part of 60 years detailing a new and exciting computer universe. He's
managed teams, written books, and published papers about the technical
details, overall feel, goals of the project, and the obstacles that
blocked the path to implementation. He's written and spoken at length
about the political and artistic decisions that have made computers
and technology what they are today. I won't rehash too much of what
he's said &#x2013; there are much more reliable sources than me, and many of
the ideas are available straight from the horse's mouth, so to
speak. If you're interested in Ted's life story, general attitude, and
understanding, I'd recommend his recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmfjM-SGlGs">Here I Stand, at Age 80</a>,
and his series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdnGPQaICjk">Computers for Cynics</a>. Further reading of his
autobiography, <i>Possiplex</i>, and other miscellany is also highly
recommended.
</p>

<p>
The aspects of his work that I'll be exploring now are detailed
explicitly in a few papers. There's <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/memex/ACM_HypertextTestbed/papers/60.html">Xanalogical Structure, Needed Now
More Than Ever</a>, Ted Nelson's Phd thesis <i>Philosophy of Hypertext</i>, and
the main design document for this series &#x2013; the titular paper &#x2013;
<a href="http://xanadu.com/zigzag/ZZdnld/zzRefDef/">Cosmology for a Different Computer Universe</a>.
</p>

<p>
Ted's computer universe does not hide the interconnected nature of
knowledge. It blurs the lines between source and substance as
references, transpointing windows, visible links, and infinite
versioning collide. Books (and blogs) become a little less <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/01/why-books-are-fake/">fake</a>, and
writing becomes a task of harnessing the infinite, rather than wending
a narrow path through a wide reality.
</p>

<p>
This is a big vision, and I'm not even going to <i>begin</i> to touch all
of it in one blog post. What I'm going to do instead is implement just
one small part: zzstructure. No views, no IO, nothing like that
yet. Just going to get warmed up, get my toes wet, and make something
that will be useful later.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I have several big hurdles to overcome in order to commence this
project:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I'm not very smart</li>
<li>I have no idea what I'm doing</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since Ted Nelson's original vision for a zzstructured universe wishes
for a program that lays alongside the operating system, I'll need to
do some systems programming. I do not usually do systems
programming. Fuck it. Let's try Rust. I've heard good things &#x2013; and
maybe it'll stop me from breaking as much stuff as I would trying to
write safe code in C. Another time.
</p>

<p>
Of course, all bets are off as soon as I start using unsafe methods
from the nightly builds in order to make Rust more pythonic so that I
can wrap my tiny brain around it.
</p>

<p>
Anyway. Let's state some expectations, starting with the ones I'll be
implementing right now.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>zzstructured datatypes
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>cells</li>
<li>links (implicit and anonymous)</li>
<li>dimensions (axes upon which links are established)</li>
<li>topology (contains the entire structure)</li>
</ol></li>

<li>utility functions for dealing with cells and links
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>iterate over the space</li>
<li>insert "posward" in a dimension</li>
<li>insert "negward" in a dimension</li>
<li>delete cell and update neighbors</li>
<li>update cell contents</li>
</ol></li>

<li>engine to "run" cells if that is their purpose</li>

<li>way to serialize the entire topology to disk</li>

<li>socket connection to data backend so that any UI can be generalized</li>
</ol>

<p>
I'm going to call this project "Slumberland" after the ill fated anime
<i>Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</i> that was a staple of my
childhood, and as a nod to the utopian pantheon that Ted Nelson
established as the basis for his work on hypertext systems.

<h3 id="orgc88a753">Part 2 - Rusty Beginnings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc88a753">
<p>
Items 1 and 2 seem like one discrete task that I can work on.
</p>

<p>
First things first, Ted Nelson's zzstructure (despite any objections)
is essentially, from an implementation standpoint, "doubly linked
lists in n-dimensions," where any cell can be part of any list in any
dimension at any time, but cells cannot exist more than once in a
single dimension.
</p>

<p>
Ted views this zzstructure as a generalization of spreadsheets, and I
happen to agree with him. We've got <i>a)</i> dimensions as a semantic
space, <i>b)</i> cells for content, and <i>c)</i> linearizability for
comprehension.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of what zzstructure is, building doubly-linked lists in
Rust is Non-Trivialâ„¢, because of single ownership (a concept that
keeps Rust memory-safe). Cells or nodes owning a "posward" cell and
that "posward" cell owning the original cell right back via the
"negward" link is #problematic.
</p>

<p>
Here's some Rust-y pseudocode. If Rust were an interpreted language,
we'd be done. It's not, so we're not. Also, ugh, I picked "cell" as
one of these datatype's name. There's a <code>std::cell::*</code>, but please
don't get mad. Maybe I'll change it in future versions.

Let's use a Rust-y pattern to give us shared references to those
attributes instead. There's <code>std::ptr::Shared</code>, but that's still
experimental. The classic way to do it is with Reference Counted
pointers and Reference Cells. You can learn about why <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html">here.</a> Basically,
though, we can pass around references and then borrow the data when we
need to interact with it. Here are our datatypes now. I've added some
derived traits for ease of use.

These are better! Done? Probably not, but they work! I've <a href="https://github.com/rfinz/slumberland/blob/master/zz/src/topology.rs">implemented</a>
a few of the utility functions I mentioned above to confirm that I can
build and move around a zzstructured data structure. Much of the
design was informed by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/linked_list.rs.html">source code</a> for the new LinkedList
collection type in the standard library. Everything had to be
generalized into <i>n</i> dimensions, and I probably sacrificed on speed
and efficiency to maintain safety. Keep in mind that this project is
evolving continuously and names / implementations are unlikely to
stick around for long. Also: I'm new to Rust, so I'll take
suggestions.

Well, very little. I have a data structure. It was convoluted enough
that despite my best efforts I understand pointers now, and I
understand more of Rust. Next I'll have to serialize the datastructure
to and from disk, so that a workspace can become "permanent". I really
can't wait. This is an exciting project with exciting
implications. Nelson's focus on mental constructs and how to represent
them on the computer will never cease to intrigue and delight.
</p>

<p>
I just hope that as I implement features the Rust can get Rustier and
the structure can get Nelsonier along the way.
