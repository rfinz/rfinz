Where do I fall on the spectrums that define mental illnesses? What
traits of my own are exaggerated and pronounced compared to the
population average? At least some <i>everyday</i> behaviors are subdued,
scaled back versions of behaviors that the mentally ill exhibit. It's
also indicated that more mental illnesses are spectrum disorders than
previously thought. Maybe many mental illnesses can be understood by
studying and reasoning about trait behaviors that are present in much
larger portions of the population. Depression, borderline personality,
clinical anxiety, paranoia &#x2013; you name it, it's too easy to armchair
theorize about where common personalities embody the traits of their
less-common peers. I think about at least one of my own traits in this
way: hoarding.
</p>

<p>
For a while now I've considered myself to be somewhere out along the
hoarder spectrum. I don't think I'm up for a clinical diagnosis (but
somehow something like <b>5%</b> of people are?  ?!), but I bump into the
emotional aspects of hoarding on a near daily basis. I understand the
deep regret that you can feel when throwing something away that <i>may
just be</i> useful in the future, no matter how unlikely that possibility
is. I understand the feeling that objects have intrinsic value, and
that it does them disservice to cast them aside. I even understand
that seeing receipts or valueless mementos can trigger a deep
catharsis or vivid reliving of the moment associated with that
object. I understand that discarding trash(?) robs you of that
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
This general understanding of my world as <b>inherently</b> emotional and
<b>inherently</b> useful influences other ways that I deal with reality (as
such things are wont to do). I have a hard time leaving places or
homes. I have a hard time re-arranging furniture. I get very sad when
my belongings first begin to show signs of aging and I do whatever I
can to prevent that (curiously I haven't had any trouble with my own
aging process, yet, but I'm young). I struggle with making changes to
my physical appearance. I hate the weeks of discomfort in my own skin
caused by getting a haircut and I hate the way fashion changes around
me, leaving me with clothes I would rather not discard but an
appearance that is outdated and dingy.
</p>

<p>
The changing physical world makes me say a lengthy goodbye to the way
that things once were, goodbye to those configurations of the universe
that are never to be experienced again, and goodbye to my gradually
earned sense of comfort and routine.
</p>

<p>
Experiencing the world as thousands of tiny goodbyes, a bath of
<i>petite mort</i>, can be exhausting.  I understand why hoarders just
choose to avoid that sensation as much as possible. Still, it's
because of this exhaustion that I feel that emotion is just as present
in the fabric of reality as space or time, and perceive that in many
ways it is just as inseparable from its fibers. It's on rare occasion
that the emotion seems to precipitate out of reality and coalesce into
something tangible, something I can really sink my teeth into, touch,
and feel. On these occasions emotion's qualities can be more
thoroughly studied, and its hidden potential more thoroughly
speculated upon.

<p>
Emotion is a complex field of study on its own. Like most of our
biological features, emotions are presumed to have had some
evolutionary purpose. Many have labored to discover what their role
might have been. One of (I think) the more pleasing and coherent
theories to come from this effort posits that emotions function as a
direct interface to our <i>goals</i>. As with all evo-psych theories, this
should be taken with a grain of salt &#x2013; its verifiability is near zero
&#x2013; but it is very beautiful in many ways, and we are able to draw
implications out from this theory that are interesting and useful.
</p>

<p>
The theory goes like this: our survival as a species is dependent on
our completion of any number of tasks for the sake of our personal
wellbeing, our societal wellbeing, and ultimately the wellbeing of our
offspring. The biological imperative springs eternal. Anything that's
needed for the completion of these tasks&#x2013; our order of operations,
our priorities, and our understanding of what is necessary (in other
words, our <i>strategies</i>) are all chunkable with this conception of a
<i>goal</i>. These goals are the basic requirements for our biological
success. Any tools that we can evolve to more effectively reward the
completion of the tasks that lead to them (and thus increase their
chance of completion), will be selected for by evolutionary processes.
</p>

<p>
Emotions, then, are those tools. They help us calibrate both reality
and our goals so that they are better aligned. In this so-called
"adaptive theory of emotion" happiness can be understood as a signal
that a goal has been achieved, sadness is a failed or otherwise
irreparably lost goal, anger is a response to a temporary state of
failure (a failed attempt), frustration is a signal that something is
blocking progress towards a goal (perhaps unexpectedly), anxiety is
vigilance for outside threats to your goals, boredom is a sign that
your goals are stale, etc. The fact that some emotions are rewarding
and others are punishing does not diminish the information-like
quality of raw emotions.
</p>

<p>
Some of these emotions are strong indicators that there is work to be
done on the outside world: anger and frustration indicate that we
should direct our (sometimes negative) energy at a target or problem
for the sake of a goal. On the other hand, some emotions are strong
indicators that we should work on our inner world: boredom and sadness
(ennui perhaps a subtle mix of the two) let us know when it is time to
change course and identify new priorities, goals, and tasking.
</p>

<p>
We can see these signals <i>in situ</i> with the five stages of grief. We
will initially deny the information from our emotions, hoping that it
may just be noise in the signal, a misreading. After you are convinced
of the information, anger and bargaining are two halves of the same
coin &#x2013; alerting you that reality could better fit your goals, that
you could overcome the source of grief, that you can strike out
against whatever it is that's in your way. Depression is sadness, a
signal to move on when the object of your goal is irreparably
lost. Acceptance, finally, is the indication that, having exhausted
your options, you can resume with your other goals. I don't mean to
dismiss loss as "just" the loss of goals. In fact, if the adaptive
theory of emotion is true, I find it quite beautiful that one of our
most instinctual, basic goals as human beings is to find and love one
another, and to care for and protect each other. It's intensely poetic
that in order to adequately signal to our brains that all is lost and
that we can move on, our body has to cripple us with sadness for days,
weeks, months, or years.

<p>
Since I feel like reality has <b>inherent</b> emotion and <b>inherent</b>
usefulness, and since I feel like <i>emotion</i> and <i>use</i> are both proxies
for something else, maybe what is present in the fabric of reality is,
in fact, <i>goal</i>. When thought about this way it's almost tactile, like
a scale model or a button printed with Braille. It manifests like a
layer of reality, a dimension outside of the three that we're used to
thinking about.
</p>

<p>
It gets weird here. Our emotions function like <i>sensors</i> in this
dimension. This is an inversion of our usual thinking. Our conscious
mind processes information about goal, courtesy of our emotions,
alongside information from our physical senses. Ultimately it's the
synthesis of all of these sources of information that guides our
action. If you've ever written a "Pros and Cons" list, you probably
recognize that the number of pros and cons have little to do with the
decision you make. It's mostly a way of systematically allowing
yourself to observe more emotional information about the different
consequences of a choice (a "choice" having very little representation
in the physical dimensions, but significant presence within goal
itself). Cognitive behavioral therapy, classical Stoicism, and
Buddhism all treat emotion in this way (although they won't say so in
as many words). They understand emotion as something to be observed,
understood, and acted upon&#x2013; just like our physical reality. If goals
resemble physical reality then their topology, as we sense it, is
reflected in the emotions they activate, like how frequencies of light
are reflected in the rods and cones they activate as they strike the
retina.
</p>

<p>
<i>Goal</i> is naturally incredibly personal. Goal contributes its own set
of forces to individual realities, the same way that gravity effects
our shared one. Goals exert their forces on us, and with the help of
our emotions we follow: like a rock resting in a local minimum as it
rolls down a hill, or an asteroid captured as it wanders lazily into a
planet's gravitational pull. Anger and obsession encourage you to
spiral in, borne by your own momentum. You can work to change course,
but it requires conscious effort. You can overcome sadness or endure
boredom, and work to change goals. Even then the attachments of your
previous goals (relationships?  routines?  precious moments?)  prevent
you from totally settling at the bottom of a new goal-well until the
force of time overcomes the old force of goal.
</p>

<p>
The way that I've mourned as I've departed the old homes of my
childhood, refused to erase whiteboards containing sentimental notes,
or kept tickets from events that happened months ago only serves to
illustrate this. Other people rushing to throw away the ephemera of
old relationships is another potent example. What is it about an
object or place that warrants its destruction or preservation?  What
about their conception in your mind conveys value, both positive and
negative?  Perhaps especially when the object itself is innocent(?) of
any crime against you, and absent(?) of any particular favor?
</p>

<p>
Everyone has their own indescribable attachments. While not exactly
obvious, these are our personal directives, our biological incentives,
and more. These <i>individual</i> goals (and realities) are relatively
easy. Where a significant portion of interest and conflict occurs is
where realities overlap: when we find ourselves occupying the same
time and space as others, but with disparate sentiments and intentions
attached to our surroundings, our physical bodies, the physical bodies
of others, and our mental direction.
</p>

<p>
We can attempt to communicate these differences and provide a
dialectical, communal, revision of goal. Language is our primary tool
for this sharing and realigning process. There are also cruder
emotional tools like violence or physical isolation, and more
impressionistic tactics like weeping openly, scowling, laughing,
etc. These are usually(?) only a last resort for humans. The ability
to coordinate without open displays of emotion or shows of strength is
part of what separates us from animals.
</p>

<p>
If we have our own goals, and we occasionally try to influence the
goals of others with language and other tools, it seems to follow that
even though every little critter has its own little goal-plane (goal
dimension?) that it comfortably wanders about, sensing lazily, their
plane is hopelessly entangled with the goal-planes of everything
else. Our family, our tribes, and our cities all behave the way that
they do because of our goals, now entangled with the goals of our
neighbors, loved ones, friends, and acquaintances. This is the social
fabric, our cultural existence, the reality that all human constructs
must be deconstructed into. For ease, and for clarity going forward, I
will now call this entangled super-set of all goal-planes <i>Zeitgeist</i>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org71d4493" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71d4493">
<p>
<i>Zeitgeist</i> can probably(?) be modeled as a literal, genuine,
bonafide, physical property of reality. It's the actual code of the
simulation. It's god's plan for us all. Whatever. It doesn't matter
what it is. It's there as an emergent property, or as an inbuilt
characteristic. When thinking things cohabitate reality, their goals
exist in superposition, an indeterminate fuzz of values and meanings,
like static from the heavens. Our personal goal-planes, our own
directives and the emotions that they evoke, are just the part of
zeitgeist that we are personally tuned to receive.
</p>

<p>
With "rods and cones" and other features of eyes, animals (and some
humans) have evolved to see various portions of the electro-magnetic
spectrum. In the case of zeitgeist, <i>every individual person</i> is
specifically adapted to perceive a different cross-section of it, and
this cross section just barely overlaps with the cross-sections of
other people. No one has the same emotional response to zeitgeist as
you, because no one can perceive the same part of the emotional
landscape. While for most things we can agree that there's <i>something</i>
there, we usually can't agree on its salient features, and
occasionally there are forms within zeitgeist that totally elude
us. These differences in emotional interface are where meaning
lives. Meanings are derivative of the goals present in reality. Value
is derivative of these meanings. Asking "which goals are we sensing?"
and "how intensely?", and "with what emotion?" helps us locate our
individual values and our individual meanings.
</p>

<p>
Of course, where there is meaning there is
synchronicity. Synchronicity is a natural formation of goal atop an
otherwise uninteresting physical reality. The feedback between our
physical perceptual organs and our perceptual organs that operate in
the much spookier plane of goals and meanings generates our luck,
chance, and happenstance.
</p>

<p>
Things begin to make more sense when you think of it this way. Do
other people perceive the same green as you? Probably not. Do other
people perceive the same aspect of zeitgeist as you?  Probably
not. Do things mean the same thing to you as they do to other
people? Um, no. Given this, will you perceive the same events as
lucky or coincidental? Unlikely.
</p>

<p>
There are many things like this that seem to exist entirely within
zeitgeist. The psychic groupings of egregores and temporary autonomous
zones, for example, must exist where the physical world is a mere
afterthought&#x2013; like with synchronicity and luck.
</p>

<p>
I think immediately of Art, which seems to be a manifestation of pure
zeitgeist. It is meaningless without an artist's (or scene's) goals,
and the goals' juxtaposition with time and space. An artist's hands
massage zeitgeist into an appealing form. The physical medium is
incidental, or functions as a focus for this form. Our good taste, our
ability to possess discernment about things with an artistic element,
is about effectively locating ourself and any object of culture (or
artwork) within zeitgeist. Locating something with GPS-like precision
is the mark of a tasteful individual. Celebrity, then, is the result
of twofold: one's actual position in (now 5) dimensional space, and
the preponderance of goal present in oneself. If you're not in the
right place, time, and locus within zeitgeist, you're not a celebrity.
</p>

<p>
All of these sound like aspects of the "humanities." Within them,
sociology is most explicitly the study of zeitgeist, since the
emotions and goals that form the organizing principles of groups of
humans only exist within this entangled goal-dimension. Surveys, then,
are a finite sociological tool designed to measure the continuous
surface of zeitgeist. Related fields, like ethnomethodology, political
philosophy, and others purport to explore zeitgeist in other ways,
with other tools, and by making different assumptions.
</p>

<p>
Our emotion, as I've explained, allows us to perceive our own
goals. Reflective empathy, theory of mind, and their more effortful
cognitive cousins are the perceptual organs that allow us to perceive
the zeitgeist around us. They even allow us to conceive of what
zeitgeist looks like from another angle, which is necessary for taste
or celebrity. Prior sensory knowledge of the shape of an object allows
us to simulate how that object must look from another perspective, and
knowledge of what an object <i>means</i> to someone else helps us simulate
the view of another facet of zeitgeist. As with drawing from memory
these simulations are crude, but at least they're available.

<p>
Like touch, sight, hearing, or chronoception, our perception of
zeitgeist is finite and subject to our human limitations. Our
understanding of our own motivations and of the motivations of others
has to be mediated by time, distance, and perceptual ability.
</p>

<p>
Our perception of zeitgeist is imperfect. Emotional acuity varies from
person to person. Sometimes our perception is limited locally by mood
swings, or through the spectrum disorders mentioned earlier. Our over
or underestimation of something's importance is best likened to a
sensor malfunction or mis-calibration, but, like with eyes that are
blurry or with ears that are dull, there are ways to augment our
emotional acuity. We can put on eye-glasses or use tools to do our
sensing in the physical world. When it comes to our emotional
faculties, these augmentations are cognitive improvements (thought
technologies) for improving our emotional interpretation or better
mental representations of the goals and emotions of others. Emotional
intelligence can compensate for a deficit in the sensors. We can build
perceptual lenses that correct for our inadequacies.
</p>

<p>
In recent history we have begun to understand the process of
correcting our emotional acuity through the administration of
pharmaceuticals (though just as often as not there are trade-offs to
be made regarding pharmaceuticals). Even common drugs like
acetaminophen influence the way we perceive emotion. Acetaminophen
dampens our own perception of pain, and (presumably through related
mechanisms) dampens our perception of others' pain as well. It has
even been suggested that acetaminophen can pull us out of an
existential crisis&#x2013; as though existential pain is a pain to be
"killed," as well.
</p>

<p>
As far as distance or breadth is concerned, zeitgeist is very
large. It's as long as the universe is wide. Wherever there's life,
goal follows. This means that zeitgeist contains exactly as many
goal-planes as there are thinking creatures in this whole
universe. Each goal-plane only thickens zeitgeist. It's dense,
complex, enormous, and we can only perceive so much of it.
</p>

<p>
Just like being physically isolated from the existence of other human
beings, or existing in another time from other human beings, we can be
isolated by existing in another aspect of zeitgeist. There have
already been 100 billion human beings, and you can only know what, a
few thousand? If your goal-plane is not closely entangled with another
person's, you will not have the occasion to interact with them. This
is especially apparent in the internet age, where physical isolations
are less important to our overall connectedness, and the opportunities
created by shared or similar goal flare in consequence. Of course the
"occasion to interact" is not the end of the influence of
zeitgeist. Goal can steer those far away, who you have no
knowledge of, into action that affects you and your own goal. This is
perhaps the case with the CEOs of coal companies, or the actors in the
global political theater, or even average consumers steering the
pricing and materials of consumer goods.
</p>

<p>
While the internet has the potential to entangle goals across great
distances, "filter bubbles" are a disentangling (isolating action) of
otherwise complex interactions in zeitgeist. They are powerful
positive feedback loops within goal itself. They are loci where the
topology of zeitgeist reaches upwards towards infinity. Filter bubbles
are machine augmented, but they have existed since the dawn of
civilization. We pick our friends and acquaintances in accordance with
our goals, and in the process we disentangle ourselves from the goals
of people that we perceive as different from ourselves. The good news
is that zeitgeist, while perhaps less malleable than space, is
definitely more malleable than time&#x2013; and there are definite discrete
actions that we can take to influence our own goal-plane and the
greater zeitgeist. We need this. The state of the world at any point
in the future is essentially the current reality + physics + goals +
time, since any change that the universe experiences that is
indescribable through simple physics can be described as the
interactions of the goals of the intelligent beings that inhabit it.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Present in reality</li>
<li>Exerting influence on us and therefore</li>
<li>"Sense-able", like space and time</li>
<li>Malleable, like space and (to a lesser extent) time and,</li>
<li>Vast, like space and time</li>
</ol>

<p>
we can start to conceptualize its shape, its isomorphisms in other
thought, and its consequences in the real world.
</p>

<p>
Zeitgeist sounds like a theory of capital. It does work that way!
Systems that purport to identify the source of value <i>must</i> be of some
use economically. Unfortunately what I've written can change
nothing. Without accurate measurement across the spectrum of
zeitgeist, I wouldn't get too excited, and I <i>do</i> think that sociology
and statistics possess some of the best tools within the limits of
current imagination. Perhaps AI will furnish us with better tools in
the future.
</p>

<p>
Zeitgeist also smacks of panpsychism. Zeitgeist is in and
around us all, coursing through the rocks and the trees, imbuing
meaning and guiding actions. Could it be <i>inner essence</i>? Could it be
the goal, the will, the <i>consciousness</i> of every person, every
<i>thing</i>? Could it describe the relational processes that create
reality? I think it is distinct from these things, but helpful to our
thinking in much the same way. It's a sort of teleology, a
biological(?) explanation for purpose and meaning, and an
understanding of how we perceive those purposes.
</p>

<p>
So what does this all really get us? Like I said before, what
zeitgeist describes is the “supra-individual” realm, the social
fabric, cultural fabric, emotional landscape, and the interactions
spinning out therefrom. It provides a term of art for the occasions on
which we must roughly quantify the effects of our actions. It does so
without straining the brain too hard. Once you have a psychic space
that behaves like a physical one, analogies flow more readily. I've
already mentioned "wells," as though I'm speaking about gravity.
</p>

<p>
In time there are moments, in space there are points, in zeitgeist
there are loci. A humane coordinate system, and the rhizome runneth
through it. A tree is planted at this locus or that. The emptiness of
outer space may be an equally empty outer zeitgeist.
</p>

<p>
We can pilot our little space-ship brain between goal-wells, taking
care not to get drawn in. We can apply our energy to moving towards
particular goals or to moving away. Either will be hard (as we
perceive frustration or sadness), and both will achieve very different
things. Most objects/spaces/times will have very little goal
associated with them, but the occasional preponderance in a person,
place, event, or thing more than makes up for it. Do you ever think
about a thing that just seems "big"? Have you ever inspected the
thing's "bigness" only to find that its actual reach is limited and
human? Has that ever happened but the thing still felt "big"?  We can
chip away at zeitgeist and attempt to change its pull, but we are
small and sometimes the pull is too strong.
</p>

<p>
So, just like the physical world, we change it as it changes us. It
can be accumulated or shaped. Gemstones can be extracted and elevated
in importance. This is the purview of historians and taste-makers, who
find substance in zeitgeist and inflate its importance. Here we find
ourselves in a strange loop: in order to change zeitgeist
intentionally, we must expand zeitgeist to contain itself and any
intention you have towards it from this moment onward.
</p>

<p>
One of the strange-loopiest things of all is politics. Politics is a
very un-self-aware attempt at organizing around and changing
zeitgeist. Of course, doing politics is impossible without trying to
assimilate the continuous surface that contains opinion, policy,
strategy, and emotion simultaneously. Political extremism is a
slippery slope into a new part of zeitgeist. The forces are eccentric
(isolated) and strong (the well is deep and steep). Those sucked in by
it are difficult to save, and find themselves impotently raging for an
ideology that isn't worth the time or energy.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Better understanding human minds depends on creating better
understanding of human faculties. Physical perceptions are only part
of the picture, and perceiving zeitgeist is in many ways more
beneficial than perceiving the physical world. Systems that perceive
utility (value) outcompete those that perceive reality. The blind,
deaf, and numb are all impossibly more capable at dealing with a
general reality than the best trained neural-net classifiers. Your
goal receptors are your most valuable sense. Professionals almost
always "trust their gut" above all else &#x2013; which seems an almost
hideously obvious allusion to the use of your emotions as perception.
</p>

<p>
I'm not the first person to see this. The adaptive theory of emotion,
the current version of which has been around for almost 40 years, and
which can trace its thinking back to Darwin, has set this line of
inquiry in motion for a variety of crackpots (and some reputable
individuals) like me. I hope that the status of such speculations can
move from "wild flight of fancy" to "viable thought technology."
Thinking of value and meaning in this way, and using a new toolbox of
physical metaphors when discussing policy, people, and socio-cultural
institutions could be helpful. Discussions of personal value, and our
conversations about the breakdowns and sticking points in
relationships with family and friends can benefit.
</p>

<p>
It's not a catch-all. It's a useful fiction. There is no way to
measure zeitgeist directly. There is no way to verify your hypotheses,
unless your hypothesis is about population level statistical
averages. And then, because of the nature of averages, and since the
tools at your disposal are generally survey instruments from the
fraught fields of sociology and psychology, you are unlikely to
capture the continuous reality that underlies the results. Identifying
a few points and creating a map from lines drawn through them does
nothing to explore the territory.
</p>

<p>
It's an interesting inversion, a mental slight of hand. The value (I
hope) is in new analogies, enabled.
