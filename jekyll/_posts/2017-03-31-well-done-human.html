It's my birthday, and although I've made many a promise to myself
to keep the quality of my writing <a href="/2017/02/13/why-to-blog.html">high</a> (obviously), and not rush
the process, I can't resist the opportunity to reflect a bit on
human, and my own, personal development.
</p>

<p>
I'm frequently upset at how well highschoolers of the past seem to
communicate. Like, actually mad. It seems as though the modern
educational system, for all of its benefits, is incapable of
turning out students that are as articulate and well-formed as the
systems of yore. This includes me. Have you read my blog? It's bad.
</p>

<p>
Everything is confounded by the lowering of barriers to entry for
high school education and a trillion other factors, but I believe
that something is happening to our youth: it's getting
longer. Stable families raise children that take longer to
mature. Loving mothers in middle class homes have created
environments for their children that shelter them from the outside
world, and it's taking longer and longer to mature. If we're going
to shelter children from traumatic (but formative[ <i>turnin up the
heat</i> ]) events (we should), then they're not going to bake as
quickly.
</p>

<p>
This isn't terrible: I'm pretty sure it's a good thing. Smoking at
18 or drinking at 21 seem pretty unwise when you consider that
human brain development isn't done until the ripe old age of 25.
</p>

<p>
Development timelines that take advantage of this fact and work
hard to shape minds while they're still pliable are pretty
incredible. We need to encourage baking at the right temperature
and for the right amount of time so our adults aren't too doughy.
</p>

<p>
That being said, it's important that we stop believing 18-year-olds
are adults. They're just big children and need the guidance,
support, and lenience that [big] children do.
</p>

<p>
None of this means that young brains shouldn't be challenged: the
opportunity for growth and human development are unprecedented
during the young adult years. But if we're going to put off all of
the big challenges until college then we need new tools to train
adults, and when college students ask to be sheltered from scary
ideas, we need to understand that they are children asking us to do
so. College students are a little under-baked. They need more time
in the oven to develop the flaky crust.
</p>

<p>
Some policies and rules already seem to support the conclusion that
"young adults" aren't quite done yet, including the ACA's clause
that allows [kids] to stay on their parents' health care until the
age of 26, the fact that car insurance (and car rental) is more
affordable at 25 ([kids] are dumb), you're not allowed on a Holland
America cruise without a supervising adult until you're 25 (okay
that's just mean), and some bars have 30+ nights (understandable).
</p>

<p>
So when does adulthood begin? From wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The first juvenile court in the United States was
established in 1899 in Cook County, Illinois. Before this time, it
was widely held that children 7 years old and older were capable of
criminal intent and were therefore punished as adults.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yeah, that's pretty insane. Seems like 7-year-olds were considered
<i>mostly</i> adults. So, since we've moved beyond <i>being able to make
full sentences</i> as criteria for adulthood, and we've moved beyond
treating sexual maturity as adulthood (who in today's right mind
would treat an 11-year-old girl or a 13-year-old boy as an adult),
maybe we can finally formalize our precepts of adulthood, and align
them with our knowledge of brain development.
</p>

<p>
So how do I feel at 26 years old? I feel like I'm finally out of the
oven. Fully cooked. Maybe a little doughy, but if I was left in any
longer I would have burned.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Great British Bake Off</i> is a great television show.
